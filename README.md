## About me
This portfolio showcases a variety of projects I have developed both during my academic studies and independently. It includes work related to finance, financial modeling, as well as machine learning techniques, with a particular focus on neural networks. The projects reflect my passion for applying mathematical and statistical methods to real-world problems, and demonstrate my ability to combine theoretical knowledge with practical implementation.
